Good Evening Everyone.

Iam Lavanya Yeturi working in Feuji as an associate software engineer in QE. I have completed my graduation and joined in Feuji as a graduate trainee.

Today, I'm soo excited to share a bit about my journey in Feuji.  I found this amazing company, Feuji, where it's like I joined a super-smart team working on real time projects.
  
 When I began working on the Sunny Rewards Project, I got a firsthand look at the world of real-time projects and collaborations.It taught me the power and importance of teamwork and collective effort. In this project, every moment was an opportunity to learn, adapt, and contribute.I felt very happy when I earned rewards for my photograph in photography contest and for giving branch suggestions. It's been an invaluable experience, shaping not just my skills but also my understanding of how impactful real-time projects can be.Apart from these experiences I also learned how to organise fun and cultural events.

The journey wasn't always easy, but it taught me that if you keep trying, stay flexible, and always aim for the best, good things will happen.I'm looking forward to continuing this awesome adventure at Feuji. Thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported all of us!

(My college years were a time of discovery, growth.After that,)(It was a crash course in the fast-paced, dynamic nature of hands-on work, and it opened my eyes to the power of teamwork and collective effort.)
