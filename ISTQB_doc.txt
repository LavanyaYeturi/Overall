Testing Principle - Testing is context dependent
Testing is done differently in different contexts. For example, safety-critical software is
tested differently from an e-commerce site

testing - A process to identify and access an application's functionality, performance, and overall quality, defects deduction,

why testing? - for quality assurance, security,user satisfaction, performance optimization,cost reduction.

error - mistakes in code 
defect - identified by the developer in development environment.

bug - identified  by the tester in testing environment.

failure - identified by the enduser in live environment.

severity - the impact/seriousness of the defect identified during testing
   It helps prioritize the resolution of defects by categorizing them based on their potential impact on the software's functionality.
1. low severity(MINOR) - less priority
2.Medium severity(Moderate) -moderate priority
3.High severity (Major) - High priority 
4. Critical Severity (Severe)-Critical priority

STLC - part of sdlc.
Phases-
     1. requirement analysis
     2. 

smoke testing - testing the highlevel functionality making sure that the application is ready for testing.

regression testing - making sure that the new functionality should not impact on the entire functionality.

re-testing - after fixing the logged defect and testing that particular logged functionality.
